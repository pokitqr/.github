POKIT QR is a platform to showcase professional skills and build REAL WORLD connections.

When there is a requirement, we are unaware of whom to approach. We know the people but we don't know their skill sets. This realization is what led to the idea of POKIT QR. Using this platform, any professionals and businesses can showcase their skills. Just share the PQR or Scan the PQR code of people you meet, get connected. Now when the need comes you can find them on POKIT QR or use the nearby feature to get quick help or even talk over a cup of chai.

At POKIT QR, we aim to help you showcase your skills and help you to connect with professionals and businesses you meet in Real World. Approach the connections which you made when you have a requirement through our POKIT search.

We will constantly work on how to make this world a better place by networking and connecting people.
